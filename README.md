## Technologies Used:
- HTML & CSS
- Javascript  

## Getting Started:
[Click here to play!](https://aidanbell.github.io/spider-solitaire/)

In spider solitaire you are dealt 54 cards to the board, your goal is
to create runs of cards, from K to A. To play, click on the card you would
like to move, and then click on its destination. Once you are out of moves,
clicking the deck in the top left corner will deal one additional card onto
every column. To move a run of cards, click on the highest value card in the
run, and all of the subsequent cards will be selected. If an empty
space exsists in the game board, you can move any card or run to it.
(Officially, you're supposed to only move a King to an open space, but I won't
tell anyone.) Once you have a run from K to A, clicking on the first card in the
run (the King), will clear the cards from the board, and allow you to keep playing.
The game is over when all 8 K-A runs have been cleared.

## Next Steps

- Sounds when dealing maybe?
- Allow user to select suit of choice
