Playing
-cards that are dealt face up can be played only on top of cards that are one
  less in value, and the same suit
-when a card is moved, the card underneath will be turned face-up
-when all cards in a pile are removed, the space will be left blank
-player can move any card or series of cards into the blank space
  -however this is not mandatory
-when no more moves are available, cards are dealt from the deck, one on each
  pile
-when the player has completed a full run (K-A), the cards will automatically
  moved to the top of the board
-when all cards have been moved to the top of the board, the game is over,
  and a win message will be displayed
